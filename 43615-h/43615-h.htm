<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Noon smote down on the field,</span>
<span class="i0">Burning on spears and helms,</span>
<span class="i0">Shining from Theseus' shield.</span>
<span class="i0">As a wave of the sea that whelms</span>
<span class="i0">A rock, and its crest uprears,</span>
<span class="i0">Through the wreck of the trampled wheat</span>
<span class="i0">The charge of the charioteers</span>
<span class="i0">Thundering broke. A sleet</span>
<span class="i0">Veiled light, and the air was alive,</span>
<span class="i0">As with hissing of snakes, as with swarms</span>
<span class="i0">Of the Spring by a populous hive,</span>
<span class="i0">As with wind, and the clamour of storms:</span>
<span class="i0">So hurtled the arrowy hail</span>
<span class="i0">Loosed from the Amazon ranks,</span>
<span class="i0">Smote ringing on brazen mail,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Struck fanged through the shuddering flanks</span>
<span class="i0">Of the stallions; and half were hurled</span>
<span class="i0">In the dust, and broken, and brayed</span>
<span class="i0">By the chariots over them whirled,</span>
<span class="i0">Which, eager and undismayed,</span>
<span class="i0">Swept ruining on to the hordes</span>
<span class="i0">Of the Amazonian camp,</span>
<span class="i0">With the lightning of terrible swords;</span>
<span class="i0">Till the dead were heaped, as a ramp</span>
<span class="i0">For the quick. But the chariots shocked</span>
<span class="i0">On the thicket of close-set spears;</span>
<span class="i0">And the long ranks reeled, and rocked,</span>
<span class="i0">Broke; and the charioteers</span>
<span class="i0">Went through them, cleaving as ploughs</span>
<span class="i0">Cleave earth: they were rent, and tossed</span>
<span class="i0">With the tumult of tortured boughs.</span>
<span class="i0">And the stallions, with foam embossed,</span>
<span class="i0">Fought, tearing each other with teeth,</span>
<span class="i0">In the red, blind rage of their lust,</span>
<span class="i0">Screaming; and writhed underneath</span>
<span class="i0">The wounded, trodden as must</span>
<span class="i0">Of the grapes trodden out in the press,</span>
<span class="i0">Empurpling the knees, and bare</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thighs of the men. Through the stress</span>
<span class="i0">Of their shoulders drove as a share,</span>
<span class="i0">Hippolyta. Avenging she came;</span>
<span class="i0">And they streamed, and they surged round her car,</span>
<span class="i0">The women: her face was a flame</span>
<span class="i0">As she rode through the tempest of war;</span>
<span class="i0">And they cried, made glad with the sight,</span>
<span class="i0">As those desiring the dawn,</span>
<span class="i0">When the darkness is cloven by light,</span>
<span class="i0">Cry for gladness: they rallied, upborne,</span>
<span class="i0">When she rayed as the sun through their cloud.</span>
<span class="i0">But she strung the bow, and she prayed</span>
<span class="i0">Unto Artemis, calling aloud,</span>
<span class="i0">As a maid might call to a maid;</span>
<span class="i0">And the Goddess of shining brows</span>
<span class="i0">Heard, as she paused from the chace</span>
<span class="i0">Upon Tainaros hoary with snows;</span>
<span class="i0">And a shadow darkened her face:</span>
<span class="i0">A shadow, and then a ray</span>
<span class="i0">Lightening, glorying, smiled,</span>
<span class="i0">As her thought pierced years to a day</span>
<span class="i0">Unborn, and an unborn child,</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With the pure fount of his praise</span>
<span class="i0">Lifted to her, from the shrine</span>
<span class="i0">Rock-hewn, at the three cross-ways</span>
<span class="i0">In a waste of hills, as wine</span>
<span class="i0">Gladdening her; and she shed</span>
<span class="i0">A wonder, a terror, a fear,</span>
<span class="i0">A beauty that filled with dread,</span>
<span class="i0">A glory no eyes might bear</span>
<span class="i0">On her maid; stooped, hushed, from the height</span>
<span class="i0">Her thought, as a bird on the wing,</span>
<span class="i0">Rained down from her, swifter than light.</span>
<span class="i0">Hippolyta notched on the string</span>
<span class="i0">An arrow, and loosed it, and smote,</span>
<span class="i0">As he drove at her car with a jest,</span>
<span class="i0">Agelaus, cleaving his throat</span>
<span class="i0">Speechless; and smote through the breast</span>
<span class="i0">Polytherses; and Euenor then</span>
<span class="i0">Felt the teeth of the flints at his veins,</span>
<span class="i0">As his mares dragged him back to his men</span>
<span class="i0">All bloody, entangled in reins;</span>
<span class="i0">Then Damastor she smote: and they fled</span>
<span class="i0">As doves or as linnets fly</span>
<span class="i0">When a hawk that has towered overhead</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Stoops, ravening, out of the sky</span>
<span class="i0">On their quires. But her arrows sighed</span>
<span class="i0">After them, swifter than feet:</span>
<span class="i0">They ran, shrieked, stumbled, and died,</span>
<span class="i0">Shot through with her shafts. In the wheat,</span>
<span class="i0">With the sunlight gilding their greaves,</span>
<span class="i0">Helmets, and shields, and mail,</span>
<span class="i0">They lay, strewn thickly as leaves</span>
<span class="i0">When Autumn has swung his flail.</span>
<span class="i0">But afar, where Thermodon rolled</span>
<span class="i0">The deep, swift strength of its flood</span>
<span class="i0">To the ocean turbidly gold,</span>
<span class="i0">Drave Theseus, eager for blood;</span>
<span class="i0">And as herds stampede in affright</span>
<span class="i0">At the reek of the beast in the air</span>
<span class="i0">Precipitately through the night</span>
<span class="i0">When a lion forth comes from his lair,</span>
<span class="i0">So the women before him fled</span>
<span class="i0">In a rout, headlong, overborne,</span>
<span class="i0">For he drave as a beast all red,</span>
<span class="i0">With the blood of the prey he had torn,</span>
<span class="i0">Circled them round; they were rent,</span>
<span class="i0">Whirled under him, flung from him, far</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Seaward, and lost; until spent,</span>
<span class="i0">Heaped in a mound by her car</span>
<span class="i0">Broken, and dying, and dead,</span>
<span class="i0">Hippolyta saw. And she fled.</span>

<span class="i0">Yea! ere I knew, while yet I thought the gold</span>
<span class="i0">Mere dross for traffic in the market-place,</span>
<span class="i0">Such ware as I had dealt in. Mine eyes now</span>
<span class="i0">See her, as she was then: the tall, slim grace,</span>
<span class="i0">The golden head upon its silver stalk,</span>
<span class="i0">As frail as April's dewy lilies are,</span>
<span class="i0">Upon some wakening lawn; or as she lay</span>
<span class="i0">With long, smooth, supple thighs and little breasts</span>
<span class="i0">Bared, while mine eyes drank all the beauty in,</span>
<span class="i0">As earth drinks dawn with gladness: but her eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Veiled suddenly, and quick red stained her cheeks,</span>
<span class="i0">Flickering, and the bright soul fled from sight</span>
<span class="i0">To its obscure recesses, while my heart</span>
<span class="i0">Filled, drop by drop, with that strange wine of joy</span>
<span class="i0">Which raced like fire through me, until each sense</span>
<span class="i0">Ached, for the joy it gave, and thirsted more,</span>
<span class="i0">In plundering such pleasure. But her soul</span>
<span class="i0">Fled beyond reach of hands, remote, and veiled.</span>
<span class="i0">She lay there as if dead, and all my love</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Was no more to her than the idle strength</span>
<span class="i0">Which breaks upon the beaches. I could feel,</span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes, she breathed beside me, and her breath</span>
<span class="i0">Came soft, and warm, through the red parted lips,</span>
<span class="i0">Fragrant upon my face. That night was filled</span>
<span class="i0">With myriad voices, myriad stars, and dews,</span>
<span class="i0">All choric! Yea, the very darkness glowed</span>
<span class="i0">With secret heat, as if the night were quick</span>
<span class="i0">By Love's own lord, and pregnant with a flame.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So was she mine, by the sword's right, whose heart</span>
<span class="i0">Went dreaming out over the unquiet sea</span>
<span class="i0">To Bergthorsknoll; and Sigurd, Olaf's son,</span>
<span class="i0">Such an one as the hearts of maids desire,</span>
<span class="i0">Being tall, and straight, and comely: never a man</span>
<span class="i0">Made such a friend or foe, on land or sea</span>
<span class="i0">His hands were skilful. I can love such men</span>
<span class="i0">In friendship or in fighting. He had come</span>
<span class="i0">To Swinefell in his fighting-ship, when Spring</span>
<span class="i0">Was white and ruddy in the fields and woods;</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And they, perchance, had bent down o'er the fire</span>
<span class="i0">As day was closing, and had spoken low</span>
<span class="i0">In the dim light; and he had sailed in June</span>
<span class="i0">Southward for prey, descending toward the Seine</span>
<span class="i0">With help from Thrain the White in ships and men.</span>
<span class="i0">And I had come in autumn with my swords</span>
<span class="i0">For vengeance of a wrong, and left Thrain's stead</span>
<span class="i0">And town a heap of ash, being in wrath:</span>
<span class="i0">Though it were shame to burn so tall a town,</span>
<span class="i0">As men said; but the heart of me was grieved</span>
<span class="i0">For some slight he had put on me, and black</span>
<span class="i0">Is a man's anger; so I gave his stead</span>
<span class="i0">A prey to the red flames; and fighting died</span>
<span class="i0">Thrain, a man's death! But when I throned her here</span>
<span class="i0">Men came and said, "Lo, now will Sigurd come</span>
<span class="i0">For love of her, to take her hence again</span>
<span class="i0">And burn Lithend for vengeance." But I said,</span>
<span class="i0">Running my fingers down the smooth, keen blade,</span>
<span class="i0">"Sigurd will come! Why then, let Sigurd come."</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But they all feared him, and again one spoke,</span>
<span class="i0">Saying, "Thy love will burn us, and our town.</span>
<span class="i0">Are there not many women in the world</span>
<span class="i0">To mate with, but the one he loves?" I struck</span>
<span class="i0">The craven fool a damned blow in the face,</span>
<span class="i0">Whereat they kept their counsel, and were still.</span>
<span class="i0">But one man, riding over a wild moor</span>
<span class="i0">When the black night was blacker with a storm</span>
<span class="i0">Saw in the play of lightnings from the clouds</span>
<span class="i0">Twelve armoured women riding, and they swooped</span>
<span class="i0">Eagle-wise on the earth, and riding came</span>
<span class="i0">To a lone house; and, spying through a chink,</span>
<span class="i0">He saw them weave a scarlet web of war,</span>
<span class="i0">With swords for shuttles, and men's heads for weights,</span>
<span class="i0">And they sang at their weaving. In those days</span>
<span class="i0">We sowed our corn with axes in our belts,</span>
<span class="i0">And each man armoured, and my people went</span>
<span class="i0">Fearfully, gazing out with anxious eyes</span>
<span class="i0">Over the seas for an unfriendly sail,</span>
<span class="i0">While I sat silent, eating mine own heart,</span>
<span class="i0">Until one ran with speed to me, as night</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Came, dropping silence on the shining sea,</span>
<span class="i0">A man with lucky eyes, who cried, "They come!"</span>
<span class="i0">Pointing toward the rim of ocean, red</span>
<span class="i0">With the sun's blood; and that sight gladdened me,</span>
<span class="i0">To see their slack sails, idle, in a gore</span>
<span class="i0">Of dying glories, while their oars dripped fire,</span>
<span class="i0">Labouring up against the ebbing tide.</span>
<span class="i0">"They will come weary," said I, "and, perchance,</span>
<span class="i0">Lack water." And I set an ambush, there</span>
<span class="i0">Where Rangriver turns bitter with the sea,</span>
<span class="i0">If thirst should lure them; and they came with skins</span>
<span class="i0">To fill; and there we played a little while</span>
<span class="i0">With knives and axes, while they ran, and tripped</span>
<span class="i0">Over gnarled roots and boulders in the dark,</span>
<span class="i0">Calling their friends, and knew not where they ran,</span>
<span class="i0">For we would call the names we heard them call</span>
<span class="i0">In feigning, and thus lure them from the path.</span>
<span class="i0">Twenty tall fellows slew we in this wise,</span>
<span class="i0">Making the odds more even, and that night</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They watched their ships, and lit the beach with fires</span>
<span class="i0">So that they might not fight an unseen foe,</span>
<span class="i0">Who struck them through the darkness. But I went</span>
<span class="i0">Homeward, and to the chamber where she lay</span>
<span class="i0">Sleeping, with tears upon her face; but sleep</span>
<span class="i0">Had stilled her troubles. As I looked on her,</span>
<span class="i0">Her breath came softly, like a child's. I watched,</span>
<span class="i0">Wondering if death might hold as fair a thing,</span>
<span class="i0">Hungering, though I would not break her dreams.</span>
<span class="i0">All night I watched her, that mine heart might keep</span>
<span class="i0">One face to dream of through the dark of death</span>
<span class="i0">If he should slay me. Then a sense of dawn</span>
<span class="i0">Stole gradually through the blue, wet air;</span>
<span class="i0">Cool dawn, with dew and silence, fair and fresh!</span>
<span class="i0">In the white light she lay there, and I looked</span>
<span class="i0">Long on her: and I left her then, and went,</span>
<span class="i0">Calling my men, and led them thence afield</span>
<span class="i0">To a smooth level sward, for fighting made,</span>
<span class="i0">Between the gray bents and the leafy woods,</span>
<span class="i0">A dancing-ground for maidens. Such a stir</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Came from the beached black ships, as April, hears</span>
<span class="i0">About the populous hives, when the blown scents</span>
<span class="i0">Lure, to their garnering, the frugal bees,</span>
<span class="i0">And they swarm forth: so swarmed upon the shore</span>
<span class="i0">Sigurd's well-armoured men: some by the fires</span>
<span class="i0">Eating, some buckling on their gleaming arms,</span>
<span class="i0">Shouting their war-songs, beating on their shields</span>
<span class="i0">Full of rude jests; and I saw Sigurd there,</span>
<span class="i0">Standing apart, long-haired, and great of limb,</span>
<span class="i0">With a soft silken kirtle, and his helm,</span>
<span class="i0">Winged, flaming in the sunlight. Then my men</span>
<span class="i0">Halted, for vantage of the broken ground,</span>
<span class="i0">While I strode out upon the sward, and called</span>
<span class="i0">To Sigurd; but blind rage gat hold of him,</span>
<span class="i0">And he came at me, whirling his bright axe.</span>
<span class="i0">And I leapt out to meet him, so men say,</span>
<span class="i0">Laughing, and ran upon him, and his blow</span>
<span class="i0">Broke down my guard, and bit the shoulder-bone,</span>
<span class="i0">But mine axe clove clean through the angry face,</span>
<span class="i0">Right to the brain; and, as I drew it back,</span>
<span class="i0">He swayed, and fell, and his bronze armour rang</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Loudly; and from both armies came a shout</span>
<span class="i0">Crying, "Sigurd is slain! Sigurd is slain!"</span>
<span class="i0">One mourning and one joyous, while my men</span>
<span class="i0">Stood round him prone, and marvelled at his strength,</span>
<span class="i0">And no one feared him now. But they came on</span>
<span class="i0">Avenging, and the crashing of their shock</span>
<span class="i0">Broke round us; and the ringing blows, and shouts,</span>
<span class="i0">And screams of dying men were born aloft</span>
<span class="i0">With dust of battle; and lightening axes whirled,</span>
<span class="i0">Lifting and falling: keen, and bright, and blue</span>
<span class="i0">They fell, but they were lifted dull and red,</span>
<span class="i0">While we rolled backward and forward in waves of fight,</span>
<span class="i0">And fluctuating chance, and those who fell,</span>
<span class="i0">Drowned there, amid the press of trampling feet.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, all day long, the uncertain combat flowed,</span>
<span class="i0">Between the gray bents and the broken ground;</span>
<span class="i0">And the smooth sward was cumbered with the dead,</span>
<span class="i0">On whom we stumbled. But at last the night</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Came, shadowing with her blue veils the sea,</span>
<span class="i0">And we and they drew off; and when the noise</span>
<span class="i0">Of war was stilled, and only moans of men</span>
<span class="i0">Broke silence, with the laughter of the sea</span>
<span class="i0">That curled, and foamed, and rippled on the beach,</span>
<span class="i0">I hailed them, and they answered me, and sent</span>
<span class="i0">Tall Flosi, son of Gunnar, their best man</span>
<span class="i0">Since Sigurd fell. Over the level sward,</span>
<span class="i0">Now with the dead strown thick as shocks of corn</span>
<span class="i0">After a reaping, strode he; and the moon</span>
<span class="i0">Tipped his bright spear with silver, lit his helm</span>
<span class="i0">And burnished shield; but when his eyes and mine</span>
<span class="i0">Met, and he knew me, he stood waiting there.</span>
<span class="i0">And I spoke, pointing, with my spear, to those</span>
<span class="i0">White faces staring sightless to the moon</span>
<span class="i0">From the smooth sward: "Lo! let us make a truce</span>
<span class="i0">And mourn these dead, for they were goodly men.</span>
<span class="i0">My friends or thine, who lie there strengthless now</span>
<span class="i0">With Sigurd whom I slew. Him men shall mourn</span>
<span class="i0">In Bergthorsknoll, as the bright gods in heaven</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Mourn golden Balder; but his praise shall be</span>
<span class="i0">Within the hearts and on the lips of men</span>
<span class="i0">A song for ever. Him I hated not,</span>
<span class="i0">Nay, rather loved! Though he bore hate to me</span>
<span class="i0">For Swinefell's spoiling, and for Gudrun's sake,</span>
<span class="i0">Her, whom mine eyes beholding, straight mine heart</span>
<span class="i0">Desired with all its strength. So for one prize</span>
<span class="i0">Strove we, nor could we yield, but one must die:</span>
<span class="i0">Whence lies he there. The gods have willed it so!</span>
<span class="i0">But let us build a pyre within his ship</span>
<span class="i0">Heaped up with spoil, and let us mourn for him,</span>
<span class="i0">And launch him, burning, on the eternal sea.</span>
<span class="i0">And when the dawn of the third day is red,</span>
<span class="i0">If your mind is for fighting, we shall fight</span>
<span class="i0">Again; or ye shall launch your ships and go</span>
<span class="i0">Over the bright ways of the shining sea."</span>
<span class="i0">I spake, and Flosi answered, gazing down</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the dead, whose armour glimmered there</span>
<span class="i0">Under the shining moon, as glimmer pools</span>
<span class="i0">Innumerable in the leafless woods:</span>
<span class="i0">"Yea, one slim maid hath slain too many men.</span>

<span class="i0">Well is she Gudrun called, unto men's hearts</span>
<span class="i0">A snare and peril! What is in one face</span>
<span class="i0">That men should die for it? A kitchen slut</span>
<span class="i0">To some dull clown is royal. But he lies</span>
<span class="i0">There, and I cannot hold mine heart from tears</span>
<span class="i0">So loved I him: I count all women light</span>
<span class="i0">As flax beside his loss. Why didst not thou,</span>
<span class="i0">When we two met amid the ringing blows</span>
<span class="i0">And mine axe failed me, strike?" And I, to him,</span>
<span class="i0">Impatient, for my wound was cold and irked</span>
<span class="i0">My shoulder: "Go, and boast among the ships</span>
<span class="i0">That Helgi fled thee. Helmsdale held me once.</span>
<span class="i0">I could not slay thee for Kiartan's sake."</span>
<span class="i0">And he, astonied, stood there, as if light</span>
<span class="i0">Fell on remembered places in his heart:</span>
<span class="i0">"Kiartan! O Kiartan!" broke from him</span>
<span class="i0">In one long sigh; and he drew in his breath</span>
<span class="i0">Quickly, remembering his brother's stead</span>
<span class="i0">Above the land-locked bays; and his heart saw</span>
<span class="i0">His mother bend down over the bright hearth,</span>
<span class="i0">With her sweet, patient face, so old and wise,</span>
<span class="i0">Lit by the flickering firelight. Thus he stood,</span>
<span class="i0">Forgetting war and death; and when he spoke</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Again, his voice was changed, and soft in speech,</span>

<span class="i0">That lit the shore, and set a watch with brands</span>
<span class="i0">To scare the wolves, who barked within the woods,</span>
<span class="i0">Snuffing the tainted air. And Flosi came,</span>
<span class="i0">Alone of all the Jarls, up to mine house,</span>
<span class="i0">While they abode there. And when dawn was red</span>
<span class="i0">Upon the third day, launching their black ships,</span>
<span class="i0">They went upon the bright ways of the sea.</span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">A voice that calls us. Yea, but look on love!</span>

<span class="i0">Like cups of carven ivory; the smooth,</span>

<h2><i>WORKS BY FREDERIC MANNING</i></h2>
<h3 class="space-above">SCENES AND PORTRAITS</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Crown 8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<p class="indent">"It is excellent work of a rare kind, and will leaven a
large lump of current literature."&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p class="indent">"Son imagination, sa curiosité amusée, son érudition lui donnent
cette tournure d'esprit et cette originalité d'expression qui nous
séduisent si particulièrement chez M. Remy de Gourmont."&mdash;<i>Mercure de France.</i></p>

<p class="indent">"Since Mr. Arnold, there has been no such ironist in this
country as the author of 'Scenes and Portraits.' Irony is not an
English quality; and Mr. Manning's is distinctly not an English
book. It is Latin in its intelligence, in its disregard of consequences,
in its presentation of the pure idea. If Lucian, Landor,
Renan, and Anatole France could have collaborated, the result
would have been some such work as this."&mdash;<i>Edinburgh Review</i>,
October 1909.</p>

<p class="indent">"They have a curious originality, and, though fantastic in the
extreme, are always singularly alert and attractive. They will be
welcomed because they contain much that is fresh and unexpected
and stimulating."&mdash;<i>Observer.</i></p>

<h3>THE VIGIL OF BRUNHILD</h3>
<p class="center"><b>A NARRATIVE POEM, IN BLANK VERSE</b></p>
<p class="center"><i>Crown 8vo. 2s. 6d. net</i></p>

<p class="indent">The name of Brunhild raises memories of tragedy, of her rivalry
with the murderous Fredegonde, and of her cruel death by wild
horses. But, though she is one of the greatest figures in early
French history, she has never been celebrated, so far as is known,
in English poetry; nor has she received the honour she deserves
from her own countrymen.</p>

<p class="indent">In this poem the author refrains from any sensational description
of her end. Brunhild is represented as giving an account of her life
and of its high political aims in blank verse of a high standard,
which is worthy of her romantic life and of her coloured history.</p>

<p class="center">Some Old-age Observations. By <span class="smcap">Charles Stewart</span></p>
<p class="center"><i>With 2 Coloured Illustrations. Large crown 8vo. 6s. net</i></p>

<p class="indent">A volume of observations and reflections from the point of view of a
man of varied experience on miscellaneous topics, ranging from sport,
political economy, and other practical matters to those deeper subjects
which exercise the mind as active life draws to a close.</p>

<h2><i>WORKS BY HENRY NEWBOLT</i></h2>
<h3 class="space-above">SONGS OF MEMORY AND HOPE</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Crown 8vo. 3s. 6d. net</i></p>

<p class="indent">"To spend an evening with Mr. Newbolt's little volume brings a rare
refreshment to the spirit. There is a quality in his verse which braces
the reader up with a sweet, winning freshness, just as a morning breeze
will cheer the tramper over an upland within sight of the sea. Sincerity
breathes in every line of it."&mdash;<i>Daily Mail.</i></p>

<h3>THE SAILING OF THE LONG-SHIPS<br />AND OTHER POEMS</h3>

for vigorous and tender verse."&mdash;<i>Globe.</i></p>

lines of true poetry."&mdash;<i>St. James's Gazette.</i></p>

<h3>CLIFTON CHAPEL AND OTHER<br />SCHOOL POEMS</h3>
<p class="center"><i>Fcap. 8vo. 1s. 6d. net</i></p>

<p class="indent">This is a selection from the Author's well-known volumes,
"The Island Race" and "The Sailing of the Long-ships," with a longer poetical
Epistle, addressed to Sir Francis Younghusband when in Thibet, and now
reprinted for the first time. The whole collection deals with English
School life, mainly in its imperial aspect; it is published by special
request for the use of Clifton College, and will, it is hoped, commend
itself to members of other Public Schools.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Large crown 8vo. 5s. net</i></p>

<p class="indent">"This combination of naval history, tactical criticism, and
poetical appreciation affords a theme which seems specially suited to Mr. Newbolt's
genius.... We can only be grateful to Mr. Newbolt for giving us a book
at once opportune for the moment, and withal so written as to be valuable
and interesting for much more than the moment."&mdash;<i>Times Literary

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Henry Baerlein</span>, Author of "The Diwan of Abu'l Ala."</p>
<p class="center"><i>Crown 8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<p class="indent">"This brilliant historical novel.... Its style is so distinguished;
it is so skilfully interlarded with mediævalisms. It reads as if it were an
old chronicle; it is full of the quaint people of the Middle Ages, with
their pointed shoes and fur-edged robes; it is full of the unruly youth
of the thirteenth century.... 'On the Forgotten Road' has the flavour
of Giotto in its pages."&mdash;<i>Queen.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Crown 8vo. 5s. net</i></p>

<p class="indent">"The work imparts a fresh literary charm to the fine old tales
about Saint Brigit, about Columcille, about St. Patrick, about the voyagers
Maeldune and Brendan, and about many old legendary wonder-workers and
uncanny adventurers. For an Irish youngster, or indeed for any one
interested, to have the old Irish tales simply, faithfully, and
sympathetically told, it would be hard indeed to find a better book."&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p class="indent">"Lady Gregory has written the most charming book that has come
out of Ireland for many a long day. It consists of original sketches and of
translations from the Irish, and from beginning to end the atmosphere,
which is delightful, is the same.... It has charm, and there is
everywhere a felicity of simple phrase that is infinitely
refreshing.... We are grateful to Lady Gregory for some hours that
could not have been more pleasant if they had been spent in the country
in actual converse with poets and dreamers."&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Large crown 8vo. 6s. net</i></p>

<p class="indent">"Lady Gregory has added another leaf to the crown of laurel
she is winning by her studies in ancient Gaelic folk-lore and legend. Her 'Gods
and Fighting Men' is as naïvely delightful, as mentally refreshing and
invigorating as her previous books.... She is at heart a poet, and the
limitless wealth of imagination of the Irish mind, its quaintness and
simplicity, its gravity and peculiar humour, have passed into her
possession and inspired her pen to fine issues."&mdash;<i>Yorkshire Post.</i></p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<h3>Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

<h3>Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a></p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

<h3>Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a></p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
